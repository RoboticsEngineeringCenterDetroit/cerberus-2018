# Cerberus
2018 FIRST Power Up Robot for Team 5577 (Detroit Cristo Rey High School, working within DHDC/RECD)

## What's Cerberus?
- The [hound of Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus).
- Also the chosen name of our 2018 robot. Other name ideas were Jolteon and ἤλεκτρον, which failed for obvious reasons.

## What's New This Year?
- 🥅 Autonomous routines to deliver a cube and (potentially) score a ranking point, on the left and right side of the field.
- 🚀 Pneumatics code to shift our drive train from low gear to high gear, as well as open and close our manipulator claw.
- 🚗 Encoder code for measuring distance traveled in autonomous drive.
- 💃 Updated IMU (inertial measurement unit) code for correctly turning a specified number of degrees.
